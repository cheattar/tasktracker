# TaskTracker  - an over engineered to do list.
I mean that header probably tells you everything you need to know about this program.
Most beginners write an simple to-do list as one of their first projects, I decided to write my own, and the result was this... Yea, not pretty is it?
Since summer was coming around the corner, and I had lots of free time, and I was feeling pretty bored and I didn't want to watch YouTube all day I made this monstrosity.

# How to build
You'll need an C++11 compiler, CMake and a reason to compile this. This program also uses Niels Lohmann's JSON library, and fmtlib, but CMake pulls them for you during config time (FetchContent).

No special instructions is needed to build this program, just clone this via git, `cmake .` and `make`.
